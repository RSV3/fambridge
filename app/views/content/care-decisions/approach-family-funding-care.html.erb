How to approach your family about funding care

Discussing money with family is difficult at any age. Many parents try to instill good money habits in their children when young but once adulthood hits these subjects rarely come up as part of a proactive, forward-thinking discussion. This can get even more difficult as family relationships and individual lifestyles change

How can you and your family reduce the fear and increase the preparation that will make your finances fit your future care goals?  Family Bridge has compiled a list of ideas for starting these conversations out right:

Set aside a regular time to discuss money and your future care, whether is quarterly check-ins, weekly telephone calls, or just quick conversations over coffee monthly.  The important thing is that you schedule these in advance and separate them from celebrations and more emotional family gatherings.
Remember you and your family are on the same team! Don't blame each other for financial problems. Instead, think of ways you can help and support each other through present struggles or planning for the future.
Share whatâ€™s working.  If you are finding automatic deposits helpful or you are excited by a particular investment strategy, share it with your family and do your best to pass along helpful resources.
Keep each other up to date about all personal assets and debts, especially with separate households. Come up with a contingency plan and make sure everyone is up to date.
Make sure you discuss and agree about the use of any extra money (such as tax refunds). If there is additional income coming in with parents, try and come to an agreement as to what the best use would be.  Every family will be different but having a consensus will help socialize decisions early on.
Communicate short- and long-range financial goals together. These are important especially for end-of-life planning and care.  
Last - and most importantly - respect family member differences and work toward decisions everyone agrees with. If you are finding it difficult, consider a third-party mediator.
