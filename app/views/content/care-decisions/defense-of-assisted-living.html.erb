In Defense of Assisted Living

I didn't know my grandparents very well until they could no longer drive, until they needed the assistance of a retirement community.  It was an interesting way to get to know people - full of magic and wonder.  They came into "The Cedars" retirement community convinced it would be a disaster…convinced that it meant being old… convinced that it meant an ending.

In reality they were lonely and isolated in their two bedroom apartment in Florida, and the Cedars was a breath of fresh air, the opportunity to have a lively social group.  They became examples of how turning 95 did not mean senility.  They were an extraordinary walking (and weight lifting!) example of what 95+ could be to other members of their community.  

My grandfather's 100th birthday was an event that the entire community gathered around.  He brushed the attention off as inconsequential, but imagine the contrast between a 100th birthday isolated in an apartment and a group of 75 people coming together to celebrate an admittedly extraordinary achievement.

I also think there is something to living in the right kind of community that discourages negativity.  At least in public, with other people, negativity does not engender popularity.  Negativity does not engender a vibrant life…and when you see others who have a vibrant life, it's easier to aspire even at 90 or 95 or 100.

Assisted living communities are often seen as dreary final destinations and have received their fair share of bad press, but for my family is was only positive.  It represented a chance for loved ones to have a vibrant social life, live close to us, and thrive in their final years.
