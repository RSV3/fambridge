Creating a POA is relatively simple. In fact the hardest part may be deciding who the agent should be and thinking about one’s end of life care. You do not need a lawyer to create a POA. However, you may want to consult a lawyer or your local area agency on aging for advice for your specific situation. Here are 5 places you can find free legal forms:

<li>local area agencies on aging</li>

<li>your doctor</li>

Tip: Have multiple original copies made. Most places (banks, hospitals, etc) will require an original copy so it is important that you have multiple to give out.

<p>
Once you have created a POA, make sure it keep it in a safe but easily accessible place. Tell your family where they can find it, or better yet, send them copies.
</p>

<p>
Next, you’ll need to put the POA on file at any financial or health care institution where you will be acting on your loved one’s behalf. This means that you will need to call up the bank, for instance, and ask about their POA policy. Some banks may have specific POA forms that they require you to fill out whereas others may simply allow you to use your own. Call each institution and ask to put your POA on file.
