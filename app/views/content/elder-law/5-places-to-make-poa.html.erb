5 Places to make your own Power of Attorney 


Creating a POA is relatively simple. In fact, the hardest part may be deciding who the agent should be and thinking about one’s end of life care. You do not need a lawyer to create a POA. However, you may want to consult a lawyer or your local area agency on aging for advice for your specific situation. Here are 5 places you can create your own POA:

1) Your state government website should have a form that you may download and fill out. If not online, they will certainly have one in the local government office.

Alternatively, there are many online services for creating POA’s:

2) Rocketlawyer.com-- This service is free and you can download the forms by state.

3)Legalzoom.com -- Legal Zoom will create a POA for you after you fill out a questionnaire about your preferences. Their service costs $35.

4)Lawdepot.com -- Another free tool, Law Depot allows you to download a personalized POA by state. 

5) Nolo.com--Nolo has a range of tools to create POAs, Wills, etc. They typically cost $40.

5.5) And of course, you can always hire a lawyer to create these documents.

Pro Tip: Have multiple original copies made. Most places (banks, hospitals, etc) will require an original copy so it is important that you have multiple to give out.
