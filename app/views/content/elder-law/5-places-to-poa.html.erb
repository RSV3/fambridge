Creating these legal documents is relatively simple. In fact, the hardest part may be deciding who the agent should be and thinking about oneâ€™s end of life care. You do not need a lawyer to create a POA or a Living Will. However, you may want to consult a lawyer or your local area agency on aging for advice for your specific situation. Here are 5 places you can create your own POA:

You can find free forms on your state government website (if not online, they will certainly have one in the local government office), local senior centers, hospitals, your physician, or other local aging agencies.
