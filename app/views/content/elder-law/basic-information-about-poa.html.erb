<h1>What is a Durable POA (for finance &amp; healthcare)?</h1> 

<p>
A Power of Attorney(POA) is a legal document that authorizes a selected person (“agent”) to act on the behalf another person(“ principal“).  The principal decides under what circumstances the POA will take effect and the specific areas which the agent has the authority to make a decision. 
</p>

<h2>Types of POA’s</h2>

<p>
General vs. Limited  A general POA gives broad authorization to the agent when the principal becomes incapacitated whereas a limited POA only authorizes the agent to act in specified areas.
</p>

<p>
Durable vs. Traditional: Durable means that the document continues to operate when the person for whom it was written is mentally incapacitated(no longer able to make their own decisions). Traditional POAs are terminated when the principal becomes incompetent or dies.
</p>

<p>
Immediate vs. Springing: An immediate POA takes effect upon its creation. A springing POA will take effect when a specific event specified by the principal occurs (such as being determined incompetent by a medical professional).

POA for Finance: Allows a family caregiver(agent) to manage their loved one’s finances. It may give the agent authority to do some of all of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use assets to pay expenses</li>
<li>Buy, sell, &amp; pay taxes on property</li>
<li>Invest in stocks, bonds, etc.</li>
<li>File and pay taxes</li>
<li>Buy/sell insurance policies</li>
<li>Manage retirement account</li>
<li>Collect income &amp; benefits--Social security, Medicare/aid, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>
POA for Health Care: This is often called a Health Care Proxy in many states. Authorizes a family caregiver to make medical decisions on behalf of their loved one. This can include end of life decisions such as life support or terminating care.

<h2>How do you get a POA?</h2>

<p>
Creating a POA is relatively simple. In fact the hardest part may be deciding who the agent should be and thinking about one’s end of life care. You do not need a lawyer to create a POA. However, you may want to consult a lawyer or your local area agency on aging for advice for your specific situation. Your state government website should have a form that you may download . Alternatively, there are many online services for creating POA’s (Article: 5 Places to create a POA online).  And of course, you can always hire a lawyer to create these documents.
</p>

<p>
Tip: Have multiple original copies made. Most places (banks, hospitals, etc) will require an original copy so it is important that you have multiple to give out.
</p>

<h2>What do you do once you have a POA?</h2>

<p>
Once you have created a POA, make sure it keep it in a safe but easily accessible place. Tell your family where they can find it, or better yet, send them copies.
</p>

<p>
Next, you’ll need to put the POA on file at any financial or health care institution where you will be acting on your loved one’s behalf. This means that you will need to call up the bank, for instance, and ask about their POA policy. Some banks may have specific POA forms that they require you to fill out whereas others may simply allow you to use your own. Call each institution and ask to put your POA on file.
